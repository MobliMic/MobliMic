### Hi there, I'm Mic (Mike) 👋

I'm a frontend technical lead working in React and also starting to dabble in some Rust and learning whatever new thing interests me!

I’m currently working on a lot of smart-home-related things in my spare time, as well as whatever side project in the never-ending list has sparked my interest 😅

 - 💬 I check in on My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moblimic/) occasionally
 - 🐤 My Twitter: [@moblimic](https://twitter.com/moblimic)
 - [Hit up my website](https://moblimic.com) where, like most developers, I start trying to post and promptly stop till I rewrite the whole thing again 😄
